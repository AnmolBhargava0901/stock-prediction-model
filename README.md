# TATA Global Beverages Stock Price Predictor

> **Deep learning demo for predicting stock closing prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. Visualizes both actual and predicted values with an interactive Streamlit dashboard.**

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates prediction of daily closing prices of **TATA Global Beverages Limited (NSE)** using an LSTM neural network built in Python with Keras and visualized in Streamlit. You get:

- Actual vs Predicted chart for stock prices
- In-browser ML demo (no code changes required)
- Clean, modular Python code ready for learning or extension


  


## ✨ Features

- **Pre-trained LSTM Model:** Uses the last 60 days of prices to predict future values.
- **Streamlit App:** Clean, interactive web UI with Plotly charts.
- **Self-Contained:** Includes code for both model training & inference; out-of-the-box demo.
- **Real NSE Data:** Uses historical daily closing prices from National Stock Exchange (India).
- **Configurable:** Easily modify for other stocks or longer sequences.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File                              | Purpose                                                   |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `stock_prediction.py`              | Main Streamlit app—model train/load, predict, visualize   |
| `front.py`                        | Alternate, fast dashboard for quick visual/demo           |
| `tempCodeRunnerFile.py`           | Example or test Streamlit script (smaller version)        |
| `NSE-Tata-Global-Beverages-Limited.csv` | Sample dataset (raw price history)                |
| `stock_model.h5`                   | Saved Keras LSTM model (autogenerated/trained)            |
| `prediction-chart.jpg`             | Example output illustration                               |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Prep:** Loads CSV, cleans & extracts closing prices.
2. **Scaling:** Prices are normalized to the 0–1 range (`MinMaxScaler`).
3. **Sequence Building:** For each prediction, model uses previous 60 days (window) to predict next day.
4. **Model:** 4-layer LSTM neural net with dropout, trained for 25 epochs.
5. **Prediction:** Trained model forecasts price for test period.
6. **Visualization:** Plotly line charts in Streamlit compare training, actual, and predicted prices.

## ⚡️ Usage

> **Requirements:**  
> Python 3.7+  
> `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run the Demo

```bash
# Launch main Streamlit dashboard
streamlit run stock_prediction.py

# For fast alternate UI (optional)
streamlit run front.py
```

- (If running for the first time, the LSTM model will train and save. Or, use the provided `stock_model.h5`)
- Edit data/model file paths at the top of the script if needed.

## 📊 Data

- **Source:** National Stock Exchange of India (NSE)
- **File Used:** `NSE-Tata-Global-Beverages-Limited.csv`
- **Column:** Only daily "Close" prices are modeled and plotted.

## ⚙️ Customization

- To use on other stocks, change the CSV and retrain.
- Modify model (layers, window, epochs) in `stock_prediction.py` for extended experiments (see `build_lstm_model()` function).
- Add extra features (volumes, technical indicators) for improved accuracy.

- **For demonstration/education only.**  
- Not financial advice.  
- Predictions are probabilistic, subject to error, and must not be used as the sole basis for real trading/investment decisions.
